2. **Rate Limiting**: Max 14 messages/second (Gmail's safe limit)
3. **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Handles production SSL issues
4. **Connection Testing**: Verifies email config on startup
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Specific error messages for debugging
6. **Logging**: Tracks successful sends and failures

### 📋 Production Checklist:

#### ✅ Gmail Account Setup:

- [x] 2-Factor Authentication enabled

- Current config: 14 emails/second (within limits)

**Security:**

- ✅ App password (not regular password)

### 🚀 Railway Deployment Notes:

When deploying to Railway, ensure:

1. **Set Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   railway variables set EMAIL_USER="vuthchanchesda15@gmail.com"
   railway variables set EMAIL_PASS="ecej jott mmpd zgco"
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
   Look for:

   - `✅ OTP email sent successfully to [email]`

### 🔍 Testing in Production:

**Test Send OTP:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/otp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully"
}
```
